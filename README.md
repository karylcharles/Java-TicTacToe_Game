# Java-TicTacToe_Game
This is a project I had to do for my vocational school.
This is a simple tic tac toe game.
The entire program was not written by me as for this project I was asked to do the gameboard initialization and win or tie condition.
This project was to assess my knowledge on conditions and data types.
